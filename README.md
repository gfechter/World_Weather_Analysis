# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview 
PlanMyTrip requested assistance with working on a travel app for customers. Initially, a variety of heatmaps based on weather data were created. A feature was then added to the app that allows customers to search for travel destinations based on temperature preferences. Then, a heatmap for the maximum temperatures for cities that matched the customers' temperature preferences, which included markers for each city, was created. 

After the app was tested, a few changes were recommended to the app. The recommended changes were to add a weather description to the weather data and to add input statements to filter data for weather preferences, which will identify potential destinations and hotels. Once these features are added, the customer will be able to select four cities from potential travel destinations. From those four cities, a travel route can be created to make the customer's trip planning seamless. 

## Resources
- Data: OpenWeatherMap and Google Cloud Platform

## Summary
The PlanMyTrip app was successfully modified. Now, the customer can see weather descriptions, filter potential travel destinations by minimum and maximum temperatures, select four cities based on the filtered potential travel destinations, and can see a direct route with information about the hotels available based on the four selected cities.
